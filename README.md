# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This is a word search game I made in my Design ang Analysis of Algorithms course (COMP 303).

It uses a two text files, one which consists of a 9x9 grid of letters and one which includes a dictionary of English words and returns all the words that exist in the grid.

I used text files because the assignment manual restriced us from using any built in libraries.
