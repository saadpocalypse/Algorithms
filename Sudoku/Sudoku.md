## My Logic
My program asks the user for a row number and a column number, once a specific cell has been selected, the program checks whether or not the cell is already hardcoded. If it is not, the program asks the user for a number to put into the cell. A function, that can be called by the user at any time, prints what lines and boxes have errors in them.
