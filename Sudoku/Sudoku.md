## My Logic
My program asks the user for a row number and a column number, once a specific cell has been selected, the program checks whether or not the cell is already hardcoded. If it is not, the program asks the user for a number to put into the cell. <br><br>A function, that can be called by the user at any time, prints what lines and boxes have errors in them. This function is called automatically at the end and if there are no errors, a victory message is printed and the game ends.
